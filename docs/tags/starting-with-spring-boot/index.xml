      <description>In this post we’re going to have different sections, in the first one, as in all beginner courses, we’re going to define Spring, learn how to create a project with Spring Boot and learn what the meaning of the basic class which Spring gives you when you start a project is.
What’s Spring? If you stop someone on the street and ask them about it, they are going to tell you that Spring is a season of the year, but that’s not the meaning that we want.</description>
