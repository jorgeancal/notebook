      <description>&lt;p&gt;For a long time, I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to achieve a better configuration in my home lab.&#xA;Since I have been working with Kubernetes (k8s) for an extended period of time,&#xA;I have always desired an overkill configuration with multiple nodes for high availability.&#xA;However, looking at the costs related to running such a setup, I got depressed.&#xA;I then explored alternatives and came to the conclusion&amp;hellip; Raspberry Pis!&#xA;I bought 6 Raspberry Pis and said which one should I use k0s, k3s or some other lightweight k8s?&#xA;Then I said let&amp;rsquo;s go for k3s, it seems easier :D So the Raspberry Pis arrived but&amp;hellip;&#xA;I moved house then my Raspberries went missing in one of the boxes&amp;hellip;&#xA;Three months later, I stumbled upon them again amidst my collection of belongings –&#xA;I tend to accumulate a lot of stuff – and by this point, I had changed jobs, moved again,&#xA;and dealt with more complications&amp;hellip;&#xA;So after 2 years, here we are again&amp;hellip; looking again at this project&amp;hellip; so I will trust my old me&#xA;saying the k3s is the best thing that I could use&amp;hellip; So let&amp;rsquo;s look at the hardware that I have&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
