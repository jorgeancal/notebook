      <description>In this post you&amp;rsquo;ll learn about how to create a small JRE for your microservices.
Firstly you are going to need a java project. So you have to go to your root folder project. When you are there you have to run the next command:
jdeps --list-deps {{jar-name}}.jar This command is going to give us a list of modules that we are using in our java microservice. I&amp;rsquo;m running this again to hello-world java service, so I&amp;rsquo;m not going to have that many dependencies.</description>

      <description>The other day there were a few news articles about the new version of Java. I was thinking another one? Really? Like a lot of people in the beginning of their careers, no-one checks the differences between Java versions because they are focused on the projects which they are working on, or maybe it’s just me. But, I had a break between jobs so I decided to update all my knowledge and one thing from my list was this one, so I hope you find this information interesting.</description>
