      <description>The other day there were a few news articles about the new version of Java. I was thinking another one? Really? Like a lot of people in the beginning of their careers, no-one checks the differences between Java versions because they are focused on the projects which they are working on, or maybe it’s just me. But, I had a break between jobs so I decided to update all my knowledge and one thing from my list was this one, so I hope you find this information interesting.</description>
