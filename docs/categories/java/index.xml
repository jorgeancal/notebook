      <description>&lt;p&gt;This always has been my priority because&amp;hellip; I don&amp;rsquo;t want to pay extra in ECR so&amp;hellip; I have to create small docker images.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;we need to list the classpath of all the libraries that we are going to use the follow command in maven ot save all of them in a file&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-shell&#34; data-lang=&#34;shell&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;mvn dependency:build-classpath -Dmdep.includeScope&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;runtime -Dmdep.outputFile&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;classpath&#xA;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;once we have all the libraries in a file&amp;hellip; we need are going to put everything in a environment variable that way we can use it later on. To be able to do that&amp;hellip; we need to run the following command&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post we’re going to have different sections, in the first one, as in all beginner courses, we’re going to define Spring, learn how to create a project with Spring Boot and learn what the meaning of the basic class which Spring gives you when you start a project is.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;whats-spring&#34;&gt;&#xA;  What’s Spring?&#xA;  &lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#whats-spring&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&#xA;&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you stop someone on the street and ask them about it, they are going to tell you that Spring is a season of the year, but that’s not the meaning that we want. Spring in IT is an open source framework  for Java Platforms which was created by Roderick “Rod” Johnson. This framework is lightweight because it has a modular philosophy, I mean if you have a base and you add the different modules when you need them or when the application is getting bigger. This framework is really popular because of it’s simplicity, loose coupling and testability.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>What’s going on with Java?</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The other day there were a few news articles about the new version of Java. I was thinking another one? Really? Like a lot of people in the beginning of their careers, no-one checks the differences between Java versions because they are focused on the projects which they are working on, or maybe it’s just me. But, I had a break between jobs so I decided to update all my knowledge and one thing from my list was this one, so I hope you find this information interesting. As everyone knows, Java has another JDK version which is the JDK 11.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
