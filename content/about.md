Hi,

I am Jorge Andreu Calatayud and this is my notebook.

This is my new project. 

In this blog, I’ll post about my knowledge and some things that I discover while I'm working. I won’t post everyday because that’s impossible. I'll try to post once per week or at least once per month. If you like my posts, stay tuned because I'm starting a Youtube channel. Guess what it's going to be called?...Jorge's NoteBook!. 

See you soon.
